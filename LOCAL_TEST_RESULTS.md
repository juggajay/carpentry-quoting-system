### ⚠️ Issues Found:

1. **Database Connection**: Cannot connect to Supabase
   - This is expected if you haven't run the migration yet
   - The database schema needs to be updated with the new columns

2. **Development Server**: Not currently running
   - Need to run `npm run dev` to start the server

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Run Database Migration
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and run the contents of `/scripts/migrate-user-roles.sql`

### Step 3: Test Authentication
1. Visit http://localhost:3000
2. Sign in with Clerk (development mode)
3. You should be redirected to `/dashboard`

### Step 4: Get Your Clerk ID
1. Visit http://localhost:3000/debug-auth
2. Copy your Clerk ID (starts with `user_`)

### Step 5: Make Yourself Admin
```bash
npx tsx scripts/setup-admin.ts <your-clerk-id> <your-email>
```

Example:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/setup-admin.ts user_2abc123 admin@example.com John Doe
```

### Step 6: Test User Management
1. Visit http://localhost:3000/admin/users
2. You should see the user management interface
3. Try changing roles and permissions

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Start dev server with `npm run dev`
- [ ] Run database migration in Supabase
- [ ] Sign in with Clerk
- [ ] Visit `/debug-auth` to verify user sync
- [ ] Run setup-admin script
- [ ] Test `/admin/users` page
- [ ] Try changing a user's role
- [ ] Test permission-based UI elements

## 📝 Notes

- The Clerk development environment uses `.clerk.accounts.dev` domain
- First-time users will be created with `VIEWER` role by default
- The OWNER role has full system access
- Individual permissions can override role defaults

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect to database"
- Check your Supabase project is active
- Verify DATABASE_URL in `.env.local`
- Make sure you've run the migration

### "Unauthorized" on /admin/users
- Make sure you've run the setup-admin script
- Check that your user has the correct permissions
- Try signing out and back in

### "User not found in database"
- The user needs to be synced from Clerk
- Visit any protected page to trigger sync
- Check `/debug-auth` for details
