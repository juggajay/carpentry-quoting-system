# User Roles & Permissions Setup Checklist

## ✅ System Test Results
All 29 tests passed! The user roles and permissions system is properly implemented.

## 📋 Setup Steps

### 1. Database Migration (Required)
Run the following SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:
```sql
-- Location: /scripts/migrate-user-roles.sql
```

This will:
- Add UserRole enum (OWNER, ADMIN, MANAGER, EMPLOYEE, VIEWER)
- Add role and permission columns to User table
- Update Quote table with createdBy/assignedTo relations
- Migrate existing data

### 2. Generate Prisma Client
```bash
npx prisma generate
```

### 3. Create Your Admin User
First, get your Clerk ID:
1. Sign in to your app
2. Visit `/debug-auth`
3. Copy your Clerk ID

Then run:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/setup-admin.ts <your-clerk-id> <your-email> [firstName] [lastName]
```

### 4. Test the System
1. Visit `/admin/users` to manage users
2. Check your permissions at `/api/auth/permissions`
3. Test role changes with the UI

## 🔒 Permission System Features

### Role-Based Permissions
- **OWNER**: Full system access
- **ADMIN**: User management + all data
- **MANAGER**: Quote management + reports
- **EMPLOYEE**: Create/edit own quotes
- **VIEWER**: Read-only access

### Individual Permission Overrides
Each user can have custom permissions that override their role defaults.

### API Protection
All API routes check permissions before allowing access.

### Client-Side Guards
Use `PermissionGuard` component to conditionally show UI elements.

## 🛠️ Available Scripts

- `setup-admin.ts` - Create admin users
- `setup-roles.ts` - List/apply role permissions
- `change-role.ts` - Change user roles
- `clear-users.ts` - Reset user data
- `test-system.ts` - Verify installation

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Database Connection**: The system couldn't connect to your database during testing. This is expected if you haven't run the migration yet.

2. **First User**: The first user to sign up should be made an OWNER using the setup-admin script.

3. **Production Safety**: The permission system prevents:
   - Users from changing their own role
   - Non-owners from modifying owners
   - Unauthorized access to sensitive operations

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Run the database migration
2. Set up your admin user
3. Test the user management interface
4. Configure additional users as needed

The system is ready to use once the database migration is complete!
